## Tasks for improving HTML Documenter

1. Add the ability to mark elliptical regions, as well as rectangular regions.
2. Add the ability to resize and reposition a region using the mouse.
3. Add the ability to have arbitrary polygonal regions.
4. Add the ability to generate HTML and CSS files (this might require going beyond just javascript; a server of some sort might be needed.)
5. (Possible much more ambitious extension): Add the ability to generate HTML from markup (such as MD)
6. Add the ability to add definitions of terms appearing in web pages, so that the user can click on a term (or highlight it) and jump to the definition.
7. Add a more automated installation process.
